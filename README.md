# mvp-expansions

What does m-v-p stand for?

## What

An array of expansions, like:

- Merely Valueless Product

## How

```sh
npm install mvp-expansions --save
```

## Contributing

Just submit a pull request adding an expansion to the list! If you think of multiple possibilities, it's best to submit them as separate PRs, as we may like some but not others.

Some other suggestions:

* be meaningful. Three random words is not good enough.
* be funny. This is very subjective, we realize, so try not to take it personally if we don't get it.
* be novel. If your expansion starts with "Minimum" or "Mom" the other two words better be pretty great.
* avoid hyphenation, especially "Minimum-".
* use actual words. You can't just make up random new words.
* Avoid names of people and products
* Avoid insults or anything that can ofend people or a group
